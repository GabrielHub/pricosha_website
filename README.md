This is Gabriel Ong's course project for a PriCoSha.
PriCoSha: A website using a system for privately sharing content items among groups of people. PriCoSha gives users somewhat more privacy than many content sharing sites by giving them more detailed control over who can see which content items they post and more control over whether other people can tag content items with a user's personal information.

Website created using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Hosted on a Wamp 3.1.3 server
